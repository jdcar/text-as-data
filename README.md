## API key instructions

In order to get the Twitter API and the MusixMatch API to work you need to have the keys hidden in another file. 

1. To get a Twitter API key, apply at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api. To get an MusixMatch API key apply at https://developer.musixmatch.com/.
2. Create a file called `Constants.py` in the main folder
3. The file should look like this:

<p>`BEARER_TOKEN = "[paste in bearer token from Twitter here]"`</p>
<p>`MUSIXMATCH_KEY = "[paste in musixmatch api key here]"`</p>
